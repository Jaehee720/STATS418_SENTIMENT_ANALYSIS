    "Our dataset consists of 4,845 rows and 2 columns, where each row corresponds to the sentiment and headline of a financial news article. We got the data from Kaggle as a .csv and are able to import it to a Jupyter Notebook, where we will be doing most of our data manipulation, modeling and analysis. We decided to stay consistent with coding in python for this course in order to gain more program experience with this tool, as opposed to most of our ciriculum taught in R. As we investigate this dataset, our research question is currently looking to see how well we can accurately predict sentiments towards financial news headlines, by performing sentiment analysis and validating with our current labeled data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Preliminary exploration of the dataset has showed us that we have a relatively clean dataset: there are no missing values and our labels are relatively balanced with 59% neutral sentiments, 28% positive sentiments, and 13% negative sentiments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Future direction we plan on taking throughout the rest of the quarter is to clean our data so it is optimal for modeling (i.e. getting rid of stop words), creating models that will predict the sentiment of the headline, testing our model, tuning, and finally creating insightful conclusions to share with the class.
